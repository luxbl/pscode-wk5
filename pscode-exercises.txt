// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

START
PROMPT user to enter first number
READ num1
PROMPT user to enter second number
READ num2
SET sum = num1 + num2
PRINT sum
END


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)
START
PROMPT user to enter a number
READ num
IF num % 2 == 0 THEN
    PRINT "The number is even"
ELSE
    PRINT "The number is odd"
ENDIF
END

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)
START
INITIALIZE a list to store 5 numbers
FOR i FROM 1 TO 5 DO
    PROMPT user to enter a number
    READ number
    ADD number to the list
ENDFOR

SET sum = 0
SET min = first number in the list
SET max = first number in the list

FOR each number in the list DO
    ADD number to sum
    IF number < min THEN
        SET min = number
    ENDIF
    IF number > max THEN
        SET max = number
    ENDIF
ENDFOR

CALCULATE average = sum / 5

PRINT "The average is", average
PRINT "The minimum is", min
PRINT "The maximum is", max
END
